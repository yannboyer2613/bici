This is the repository of BICI, a very dumb and basic Brainf_ck interpreter written in C++20.




Tested on :


-> An Apple M1 ARMv8.4 CPU at 3.2GHz, using this CPU it takes about 7 seconds to complete the mandelbrot.bf program using my interpreter.

-> a Ryzen 5 PRO 4650U at 4GHz, x86 based, takes about 9 seconds for interpreting the same program(mandelbrot.bf).
